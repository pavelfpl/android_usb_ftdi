I am experiencing some extra bytes present in buffers when reading from SPI (tried with FT232H chip on WinXP & Debian). 
Most of the time there is one extra byte, sometimes two. This gave me a lots of errors until I figured this out.
I have added the attached workaround to prevent this. 

- must be tested !!!
